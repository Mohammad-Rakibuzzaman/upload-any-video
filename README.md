# upload-any-video
This is basically a given task where i have to implement the frontend part using react and backened api using django. The main purpose of this project is to implement the reactflow library which you can install using (npm install reactflow), Its a special library which helps us to make interactive node and components. Adding animation and style is done by using talwindcss as usual also i have added some other feature in this project. Here anyone can upload any small video and then up it to there it will save directely to the sqlite database which is a builtin database in DJANGO. In future i will move this SQLITE DATABASE to POSTGRESQL for uploading large files. 

Update: Upload-any-video 0.1
i) added postgresql database
ii) environ security is now enabled
